### Inspiration
With the rise of social media, it is now easier than ever to learn about mental health. At the same time, it has also become incredibly easy to confuse what is or isn't a symptom. We wanted to create a project that could help confused users know whether or not their mood was worrisome, and provide resources and next steps for everyone. Our website includes two screeners for the most common mental illnesses in America, alongside resources and FAQs.

### What it does
Users can read informational materials under the "Resources" or "Frequently Asked Questions Tab". In addition, users can assess their own symptoms using the "Depression Survey" and "Anxiety Survey". Taking a survey will lead the user through a series of questions and present them with a score, estimating the severity of any present symptoms.

### How we built it
The landing page, "Resources" page, and "Frequently Asked Questions" page were all constructed with HTML and CSS by Yewon and Grace. The screener surveys for depression and anxiety were constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with help from Yerim and Sky.

### Challenges we ran into
Coding is hard.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our product is functional! It's not pretty, but it is very functional.

### What we learned
Yewon became a full-stack developer overnight, this was Grace's first time using her coding skills outside of self-studying, Sky and Yerim learned HTML/CSS AND JavaScript in one night.

### What's next for Mental Health Resources and Screeners
Making the site more accessible for users with vision disabilities, translations into other languages, and ability to save results to discuss with clinician.
