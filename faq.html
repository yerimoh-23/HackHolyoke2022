</header>

<p><b>What is the difference between mental health and mental illness?
</b></p>
<p>Mental health is something we all have, the same way we all have physical health. It is affected by biological factors, life experiences, and family history. Mental illness is a health condition that causes changes in the way we think, feel, or behave. </p>

<p><b>Is there something wrong with a person if they have a mental illness?</b></p>
<p>Having a mental illness does not mean a person is “bad”, it is simply a medical condition the same way heart disease or diabetes doesn’t mean someone is bad. In fact, mental illnesses are extremely common, with about 1 in 5 Americans experiencing mental illness within a given year.</p>
<fieldset></fieldset>

<p><b>Are there specific causes to mental illnesses?</b></p>
<p>There are several factors that can contribute to mental illness, such as life experiences, biological factors, stress, and usage of alcohol and drugs. There is not one specific cause behind mental illnesses.</p>

<p><b>Where can I find a therapist?</b></p>
<p>Your insurance company or community services can help you find a therapist that fits your needs. If you’re a college student, consider checking out your campus counseling center.</p>
<fieldset></fieldset>

<p><b>Can I get cured from mental illness?</b></p>
<p>Although there is no universal cure to mental illness, many patients can achieve a life of little to no symptoms with the help of therapy (individual or group), medication, and lifestyle changes.</p>
<fieldset></fieldset>

<p><b>I have some symptoms. Does that mean I have a mental illness?</b></p>
<p>A diagnosis can only be made by a trained medical provider. If you feel that you have symptoms and want to look into getting a diagnosis, speak with your primary care provider. They may refer you to a specialist, or talk about alternatives with you.</p>
<fieldset></fieldset>

<p><b>What do I do after getting a diagnosis?</b></p>
<p>The medical provider who diagnoses you should help you figure out your next steps, which can include emotional, physical, and medicational support. Oftentimes, you can ask for accommodations in your school or workplace to help with the symptoms of your diagnosis.</p>
<fieldset></fieldset>

<p><b>What warning signs should I look for within myself or others?</b></p>
<p>Although there are many warning signs for mental illnesses, you should keep an eye out for changes in diet, losing interest in daily activities, sudden crying or anger, or giving away prized possessions. Offer to talk with them, or refer them to community resources.</p>
